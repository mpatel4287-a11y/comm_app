## Task
Ensure that all members in the same sub-family have the same first 2 digits of familyId in their MID.

## Problem
- The MID format is `F{XX}-S{XX}-{XXX}`
- The first 2 digits (XX) should come from the main family's `mainFamilyId`
- Currently, the manual "DKT Family ID" field can cause inconsistency

## Solution
In `member_service.dart`, use `subFamilyDoc.data()?['mainFamilyId']` instead of the manually entered `familyId` for generating the MID.

## Files to Edit
- `lib/services/member_service.dart`

## Steps
1. [ ] Update `addMember` method to use `mainFamilyId` from subFamilyDoc for MID generation
